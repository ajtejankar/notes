# Notes

A simple script that creates commit messages from lists
of todos. It also has support for saving your todos in
a dropbox folder.

## Installation

The script is written in bash, so you'll need a terminal
running bash.

To install, clone this repo somewhere and
add its path to the `PATH` variable.
